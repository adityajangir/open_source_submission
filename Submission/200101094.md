## Interests


#### Competitive Programming
I love solving problems that challenge me and Competetive Programming is a great way to not only improve my knowledge and application of algorithms and data structures but also a great way to improve my logical thinking.
I have a 1236 rating on Codeforces
<br>

#### OpenSource
I like contributing to OpenSource projects because they help provide the experience of contributing to a real world project.
As a part of Google Code In I contributed to CCExtractor and built a Subtitle File Translating tool.
<br>

#### App Development
App development is a great way to make a product available to a lot of people.
I interned at QKRes Solutions as an App Developer and worked on an app to be implemented at IIT Madras to book seats at their mess or appointments at the hospital.
<br>

#### Machine Learning
I find this area of Computer Science to be extremely interesting and intruiging. I am still exploring and learning its basics.
