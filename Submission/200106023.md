## My interest in various fields of coding.

My basic interest lies in the field of ML and AI.
I have also started to learn C++ for competetive Programming.
Also have taken courses of HTML & Flutter via the SWC platform.
But as of previous experience I have no previous experience but would love to explore this field.
