- __Design__: I want to explore this field as it will improve my design skills which will help me in web designing part as well.But I am starting in this field via coding week .
- __Machine learning__: I have done a small workshop in it and find it interesting but i will explore this field during my sem break as i can't handle all this with my regular acads.
