## INTERESTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS
I have always had a great interest in solving various kind of puzzles, at the later stage coding was one of the pathway which kept me connected to solving those puzzles and using my brain to very extent. Also i find various apps very facinating and am always curious to know what makes these apps to run in such an effcient manner.
