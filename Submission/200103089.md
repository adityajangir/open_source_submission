Interest in Different Fields of Coding
The areas in Coding where my interests lie are in Machine Learnnig, AI, Web Development and Game Development. I seem to get into these areas because I started coding few months other than my studies the language I chose was JAVA and currently on python due to machine learning. I would be continuing in ML and AI and explore myself in Web and Game development also.As now we are thought C language which I might take ahead to C++ for higher level coding which I think might get into.

Achievement
1. I am totally new to this coding thing just practised a few languages.
2. Practising ML from a course recommended by Coding club.
