# WHY I LIKE TO CODE

I am very enthusiastic when it comes to develope some applications of my own.
This can be achieved if I start learning coding and development.

>WHAT I LIKE IN CODING
1. I am interested in WEB DEVELOPMENT(particularly HTML AND CSS).
2. Also in COMPETETIVE PROGRAMMING and have started on hackerrank.
3. Also want to try APP DEVELOPMENT ( do not have much idea about it).
