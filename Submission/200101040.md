## My interests

<br>

1.**open source** :- Open source feels very cool and I find it very interseting and i find it very udeful, a lot to learn and this is my first attempt towards open source

2.**Competitive Coding** :- The logic we use, the pressure we handle due to time constraints is of very significance. I have started taking part in contets but not a lot of time has passsed, but surely i am loving it

3.**Web Development** :-I am really interested in webDevelopement. Currently i am learning django and its a lot interseting than i thought.

4.**App development** :- I also want to explore app development ,Nothing have i explored as of now, but thinkimg to start soon.
