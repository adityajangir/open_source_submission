Interests  
 I am an absolute beginner to coding but I do have a basic idea about few fields. 
 Based on that I can say that I would really like to learn about *ML* as well as *D*L as python is one of the easiest languages to learn.
 I would also like to explore _App development_ but I have very little idea about it.
 I also found _open-source_ very interesting while learning about it so I wouldnâ€™t mind diving deep in this field as well.
