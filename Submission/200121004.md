```c++
#include<iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
int sum=0;
char myname[] = "Amay Singh";     // We can also input other names by using functions like cin, getline etc
for(int i=0;myname[i]!='\0';i++)  // end character os strings in c++ is \0
  {
    if(myname[i]==' ')            // to exclude space between different parts of name

### My Interests in various fields of coding

* __Competetive Coding :__ I love problem solving and have participated in various olympiads. I regularly use sites like brilliant for practising problem solving. I can think deeply on logical problems/puzzles for hours and not get tired. Recently i have started solving coding problems from codeforces.
* __Web development and App development :__ i like to build full projects (both backend and frontend). I've learnt decent level of HTML, Visual Basic and C++
* __Cyber Security and Hacking :__ I'm interseted in learning how the software architecture and security systems work. I've self learnt the basics of cryptography and the mathematics behind it
