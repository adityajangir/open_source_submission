#Intrests!
1. I am a newbie in this field and want to explore it deep down.
    My major field of intrests are -
     
     * App Development
     * ML & AI
     * Cyber Security

   Though I haven't tried out much my hands on these but I'll skill it up all well.
    
2.  Also I have some project ideas on which I would like to work upon which 
    are majorly related to App Development.
