My Interests

1. Web Development

>I attended an intro course on Frontend, am attending one on Backend and will attend many more to grow and to get guidance on how to become a good Full Stack Developer.

>I have always wondered how various organisations set up their own websites and send us a webpage upon request, or how does one beautify a boring looking HTML webpage.

2. Open Source
>The Open Source Task was my first ever experience in anything related to Open Source and I found it very interesting.

>Currently, I have no contributions in Open Source but am going to explore more in this field.

3. Competetive Programming
>I have experience in programming but not much in Competetive Programming. I think it is a very important field and it really tests our problem solving and coding skills.

>I have plans to compete in several upcoming contests.
