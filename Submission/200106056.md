Hi, so I've been dabbling into coding since 7th std, thanks to 'Automate the boring stuff with python', although have never done coding very seriously.
Interests would be Computer Vision, App development etc
 
Notable achievements include 

1. A name repetition machine built in 8th using a tts module on android based python compiler

2. The 'Anti Lonely App'. Basically a one-to-one texting android application made for my girl using MIT Scratch and Firebase. Currently trying to make second version using Flutter

3. Trying to make a Resistor Sorter machine for the IITG electronics club, which'll use openCV to calculate value of a resistor based on the bands, and then sort them.
