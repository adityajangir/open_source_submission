Hello there, alothough I'm interested in everything related to coding as you always get to learn something new, in particular, the field I'm most interested in is Game Development and there are two reasons for it:-
> 1. It fascinates me the way games work, like how a certain prgoram can make such beautiful graphics.
> 2. C# and C++ are the top languages used in game development and I happen to like C++ the most.
Another field I like is open source. It feels good to solve real world problems.
As I'm an enthusiastic beginner , I don't have any noticeable achievements as of now.
